1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platformYour Palette URL: Your Rationale:http://paletton.com/#uid=52I0N1kY7NJ3csbvlPE00mDbhcikL++aKf34+38tceuQ8vMuk0yg31q6P3CqGid1Gf7bHI chose these colors because I really like how they flow together the green, blue, gray gives the user a nice vibrant chill experience with the gaming console. Also, the colors are just hurting your eyes from being too bright, these colors go easy on the eyes but does the job of grabbing the end users attention.

Spring is the type of season that is represented by bright colors, as the flowers start to 
bloom there is all types of colors surrounding us especially at Botanical gardens. Thus, I have chosen a palette with light green, light red, and a dark pink color for a spring time tour at Botanical gardens.

In a private messaging app in my opinion you should have base dark colors and maybe even a few vibrant colors thrown in to the webpage. In this case I tried to go with some what of the Facebook/ twitter look, but I tried to give it more of a stealthy type of feeling to give the user a sense of feeling that they are being secretive and the webpage may give them that comfort of being protected.

Ruby on Rails usually consists of using the colors Red white and black as there logo colors. In this case I used a monochromatic color palette using Red as the base and grey, white, black text, I feel that this displays to the end user that this color relates to the software product of ruby on rails when they are looking at the advertisement.
